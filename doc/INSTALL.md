## Installation

To install the SubPageList extension use [Composer] with [MediaWikis built-in Composer support].

```shell script
COMPOSER=composer.local.json composer require --no-update mediawiki/sub-page-list:~2.0
```

```shell script
composer update mediawiki/sub-page-list --no-dev -o
```

Then enable the extension by adding the following to the bottom of your wikis
[LocalSettings.php] file:

```php
wfLoadExtension( 'SubPageList' );
```

### Verify installation success

As final step, you can verify SubPageList got installed by looking at the Special:Version
page on your wiki and verifying the SubPageList extension is listed.

## Configuration

After you are done with installing, it is time to update your configuration.

Configuration of SubPageList is done by adding simple PHP statements to your
[LocalSettings.php] file. These statements need to be placed AFTER the inclusion
of SubPageList. The options are listed below and their default is set in the SubPageList
settings file. You should NOT modify the settings file, but can have a look
at it to get an idea of how to use the settings, in case the below descriptions
do not suffice.

### Required subpage settings

MediaWiki itself has some support for subpages, which causes back links
to be displayed on subpages to their parent pages. To enable this you
need to set [$wgNamespacesWithSubpages], which is a per namespace setting,
like shown below:

```php
$wgNamespacesWithSubpages[NS_MAIN] = true;
```

### Optional subpage setting - Automatic refresh

MediaWiki by default caches the content of pages. This means that when you have
a sub page list, and one of the pages in this list gets moved or deleted, or a
new page is created that should show up in this list, the list will not be updated
automatically right away. You will need to wait for the cache to expire, or manually
purge the cache.

SubPageList comes with an option to automatically invalidate the cache of all pages
in a page tree when one of its pages gets modified. A page tree is a root page and
all of its children.

This option is off by default and can be turned on with:

```php
$egSPLAutorefresh = true;
```
